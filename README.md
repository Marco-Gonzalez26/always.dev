This is my blog!, Made with NextJs, tailwind, Framer Motion and MDX Components!

Here you can find articles about FrontEnd and BackEnd technologies 

Also you will find a list of courses I've made if you are interested, a list of books that I read about programming and a list of the Youtube Channels that I visit always when I want to update myself with news about Javascript and Programming in general
